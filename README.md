# ClothingClassification
 Final Project for BLM22325

 This is a group project done for the Introduction to Machine Learning course. It focuses on a multi-class classification problem. The images used are organized within the clothing_images folder and are categorized as upper_wear, other, and lower_wear. These are further divided as follows: for lower wear – skirt, pants, shorts; for other – shoes, bag, hat; and for upper wear – shirt, sweater, and t-shirt.

 The images were collected and filtered using a scraper from the internet. To ensure proper file paths, a script named renamer.py was created, and the images were renamed sequentially along with their respective folders.

 CNN and XGBoost were compared, with the ResNet50 architecture used for the CNN algorithm.

 The images have been removed. However, the project can be adapted for different classification tasks by modifying the necessary parts while keeping the same structure.
